BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
1.1 Introduction.
Access to clean and reliable water is crucial for the well-being and development of communities. In Tanzania, like many other countries, water wells play a vital role in providing this essential resource. However, ensuring the functionality and sustainability of these wells can be challenging due to various factors such as geographic location, infrastructure maintenance, and water quality.

The Tanzania Water Wells project aims to leverage data science techniques to predict the functionality of water wells across different regions in Tanzania. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, we can develop a predictive model that will aid in optimizing maintenance efforts, resource allocation, and decision-making processes related to water well management.

1.2 Problem Statement.
The main challenge faced by water authorities and organizations in Tanzania is the high number of non-functional or partially functional water wells. These dysfunctional wells result in limited access to clean water for communities, leading to health and sanitation issues, reduced agricultural productivity, and hindered economic growth.

To address this problem, the project focuses on answering the following key questions:

Which factors contribute most significantly to the functionality of water wells?
Can we accurately predict the functionality of a water well based on its geographic location, water quality, and infrastructure conditions?
How can we prioritize maintenance efforts and resource allocation to ensure the sustainable operation of water wells?
By providing insights and predictive capabilities, this project aims to assist water authorities, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in making informed decisions to improve the functionality and sustainability of water wells across Tanzania.

1.3 Objective.
The objective of the Tanzania Water Wells project is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the functionality of water wells in Tanzania. By leveraging historical data and applying data science techniques, the project aims to address the challenge of non-functional or partially functional water wells, ultimately improving access to clean water for communities.

Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following:

Develop a predictive model: Build a machine learning model that can predict the functionality of water wells based on various attributes such as geographic location, water quality, and infrastructure conditions.

Identify key factors: Determine the most significant factors that contribute to the functionality of water wells in Tanzania. By analyzing the data, the project seeks to uncover insights and correlations that can aid in understanding the underlying causes of well functionality.

Optimize maintenance efforts: Provide actionable recommendations to prioritize maintenance efforts and allocate resources effectively. By accurately predicting the functionality of water wells, the project aims to optimize the allocation of maintenance teams and resources, ensuring efficient and timely repairs.

Enable data-driven decision-making: Empower water authorities, policymakers, and NGOs with a data-driven decision-making framework. By providing insights and predictions, the project aims to facilitate informed decisions regarding water well management, resource allocation, and long-term sustainability.

1.4 Specific Objectives.
To aid in improving maintenance operations by focusing inspections on the water points that have a high likelihood of requiring repair or having failed altogether

To provide 70%-75% accurate predictions on the functionality of wells

To determine if functionality varies by quantity.

To determine the functionality status concerning payment type

1.5 Business Questions.
What is the most popular water point type?

Does functionality vary by payment type?

Does altitude affect the class of extraction type?

1.6 Project Success Criteria.
Build a model that meets the following criteria:

Use machine learning models to correctly classify wells with an accuracy score of 70% - 75%

1.7 Approach.
To tackle this business problem, we will employ data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze a comprehensive dataset containing information on water wells in Tanzania. This dataset includes attributes such as the well's geographic location, operational status, water quality parameters, pump types, and construction details.

The project will involve the following key steps:

Data Understanding: Gaining insights into the structure, quality, and characteristics of the data to inform subsequent analysis and modeling steps.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Gaining insights into the data, identifying correlations, and understanding the distribution of variables.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features that can contribute to the prediction of water well functionality.
Model Selection and Training: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics and validating its robustness.
Deployment and Recommendations: Utilizing the model to predict the functionality of new water wells and providing actionable recommendations for maintenance prioritization and resource allocation.
