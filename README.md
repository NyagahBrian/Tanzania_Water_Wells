**BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.**

**Introduction.**
Access to clean and reliable water is crucial for the well-being and development of communities. In Tanzania, like many other countries, water wells play a vital role in providing this essential resource. However, ensuring the functionality and sustainability of these wells can be challenging due to various factors such as geographic location, infrastructure maintenance, and water quality.

The Tanzania Water Wells project aims to leverage data science techniques to predict the functionality of water wells across different regions in Tanzania. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, we can develop a predictive model that will aid in optimizing maintenance efforts, resource allocation, and decision-making processes related to water well management.

**Problem Statement.**
The main challenge faced by water authorities and organizations in Tanzania is the high number of non-functional or partially functional water wells. These dysfunctional wells result in limited access to clean water for communities, leading to health and sanitation issues, reduced agricultural productivity, and hindered economic growth.

**Objective.**
The objective of the Tanzania Water Wells project is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the functionality of water wells in Tanzania. By leveraging historical data and applying data science techniques, the project aims to address the challenge of non-functional or partially functional water wells, ultimately improving access to clean water for communities.

**Specific Objectives.**
To aid in improving maintenance operations by focusing inspections on the water points that have a high likelihood of requiring repair or having failed altogether

To provide 70%-75% accurate predictions on the functionality of wells

To determine if functionality varies by quantity.

To determine the functionality status concerning payment type

**Project Success Criteria.**

Build a model that meets the following criteria:

Use machine learning models to correctly classify wells with an accuracy score of 70% - 75%


**FINDINGS.**


The most common extraction type is gravity but second is hand pumps. The efficiency of handpumps are less than commercial pumps. It shows that authorities need to focus on pumping type. It is seen that, there are many non-functional water points which belongs to gravity (which is natural force so no need to do anything expensive) as extraction type.

Iringa is one of the important areas but it contains lots of non-functional wateer points which has soft water.

Government of Tanzania funds most of the waterpoints and are also among the top installers of water wells.

Communal standpipe seems to be the most popular waterpoint type.

Functional water wells were able to provide enough water to the population.

A majority of wells found in the most populated areas need repairs, probably due to scrumbling and overusage.

Majority of the functional wells provided enough water. However, there is an alarming number of non functional wells.

The functional water points wer the most populated.

Most water points that are not paid for are non functional.

Wind powered and rope pump have the least amount of water available.

The most common extraction type is gravity followed by hand pumps.

**RECOMMENDATIONS.**


The Government of Tanzania should put proper measure to ensure the mantainance and functionality of their waterpoints as a big number of them are non functional or need reopairs.

The Government of Tanzania should make effort to ensure availability of water to the sparsely populated areas too as most of these sparsely populated ares did not seem to have enough water.

The Government should channel more funds towards communal standpipe as most of them are non functional.
